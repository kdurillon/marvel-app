```

## Running the tests

To run the tests, go to the project root and execute following command :
```
phpunit

```


## Built With

* [Symfony 3.1.1](https://symfony.com/doc/3.1//index.html) - Used version 3.1.1 because it was the last 
version i worked on so it was easier for me to begin
* [Bootstrap 3](http://bootstrapdocs.com/v3.0.3/docs/css/) - Used version 3 because version 4 is still 
in alpha
